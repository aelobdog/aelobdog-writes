Resetting the Blog

I did it again.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
I promised myself I wouldn't but I still did it.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Resetting the blog has become some kind of a joke at this point but it isn't one that I particularly enjoy. For one, it is a lot of work rewriting the blog generation system and not only that, it is also quite a pain in the ass to write content again.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
So there it is. New blog. New blog-gen tool.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Hopefully, this blog doesn't need a rewrite any time soon. Until then, here I am, serving you with "content" you didn't ask for but that you're getting anyway.
