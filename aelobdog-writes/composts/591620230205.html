Picture this.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
You're walking down a bustling road in your university, surrounded by people walking to and from their classes. There's a quiet little breeze and the sun's not that hot. You're enjoying your walk back after another one of those boring classes you didn't actually want to attend in the first place. As you walk, you can hear bits and pieces of other people's conversations. Normally, you'd just hear them complain about an assignment that's due soon, or about how they got screwed over in some test for the nth time.

These kinds of conversations were so common previously; I was a bit startled when the conversations suddenly changed. For the past few weeks all I've been hearing about is ChatGPT. It isn't that uncommon to hear someone say "you know what I did yesterday? I wrote a few pages of my thesis using ChatGPT!", followed by "Only a few pages? I wrote my whole project report using ChatGPT!" This ChatGPT crazr really is an interesting phenomenon. Over the past few days, I've learnt a lot about how students at my university are making use of this wonderful new tool. It seems to be writing people's project reports, thesis reports, university applications, doing literature surveys, converting code from one programming language to another, writing CS lab assignment solutions; heck I even used it to write a few songs for me.

ChatGPT seems to be doing a LOT more work than my fellow students lately. This isn't just some kind of a hot take though. It is merely an empirically observed fact. And I don't really mean it in a derogatory sense. I mean students have always used Google and its search results for these things. So what's changed? Well, the biggest change is the way this situation is being treated. Among the students (well those who are serious, anyways) plagerising webpages was looked down upon. Now? Now it is considered smart! Using ChatGPT to <em>"paraphrase"</em> its answers also allows students to ensure that their plagerism scores are not very high.

I don't know if I come across as someone who disapproves of this, and if I do, I don't mean to. I mean, I'm still not sure where I stand on this matter. I do use it on a regular basis, in a similar fashion to how I would've used Google in its absence. I use it to retrieve information in a structured, more dense form than Google search results. And I feel like if that is your use case, I highly recommend using it. It saves a lot of time and effort which could be spent processing and making sense of the retrieved information.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
But solving assignments? Writing reports? I don't know where I stand regarding the use of ChatGPT for these tasks. I mean sure, almost nobody I know is really <em>into</em> university assignments and stuff, and its been a really long time since I've seen a genuinely interesting assignment. So I get it, I empathize with my fellow mates. But whether they're interesting or not, assignments, reports, etc. are the current best way our colleges know how to teach us stuff. So if you're using ChatGPT to solve your DSA class assignments, you're not really going to learn anything at all eh? Sure you'll <em>"learn it on the job"</em>, I can't imagine how many time's I've said that very same thing to my peers. But you won't even know the basics, will you? If you don't know the basics, you can't learn them on the go. That's because you won't know when the right time is to use them, so how'll you know if you have to learn them when the time comes?
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
I'm not sure what the conclusion is here. I do believe that there's no way any kind of good quality research will happen if students continue to abuse this wonderful tool to just "collect information" and "dump it" in an "AI generated report." Leave research out of the picture if you wish to do so. You'll just end up creating a bunch of (incompetent) software developers who scored well on their college tests but don't have any clue as to how to go about developing so much as a slightly complicated codebase. Unless of course, those same students used the time they saved by using ChatGPT to learn stuff.
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 1.5em; overflow: hidden"></span>
Maybe some day I'll come to a conclusion about this. Maybe I'll find some kind of a fix to this "problem", if I actually determine that this is indeed a problem. Maybe I'll write about it then. A lot of "maybe"s huh. Well, isn't that the same with all of us?
