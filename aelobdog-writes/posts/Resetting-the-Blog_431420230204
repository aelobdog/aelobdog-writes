#1 Resetting the Blog
#4 04 Feb 2023

I did it again.

I promised myself I wouldn't but I still did it.

Resetting the blog has become some kind of a joke at this point but it isn't one that I particularly enjoy. For one, it is a lot of work rewriting the blog generation system and not only that, it is also quite a pain in the ass to write content again.

But it is what it is.

New blog. New blog-gen tool. New content.

Hopefully, this blog won't need a rewrite any time soon. Till that day comes, here's some content for you to binge on the toilet, or wherever it is that you read your favorite blog posts.
